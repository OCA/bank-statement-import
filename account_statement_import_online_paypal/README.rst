Configuration
=============

You will need a *Client ID* and *Secret* from PayPal to communicate with the PayPal API. To obtain your PayPal API
*Client ID* and *Secret*:

#. Open `PayPal Developer <https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/>`_.
#. Login with your *PayPal for Business* account (upgrade your personal account to
   a Business Account, if required).
#. Go to *Apps & Credentials* and switch to *Live*.
#. Under *REST API apps*, click *Create App* to begin creating a new application.
#. Enter a descriptive name for your app (e.g. *Odoo-Statements*) and click *Create App*.
#. Copy the *Client ID* and *Secret* to use during provider configuration (instructions below).
#. Under *Features*, uncheck all optional features except *Transaction Search*.
#. Click *Save Changes*.

To configure PayPal as an online bank statement provider, you will need to create a Bank Account & Journal that
corresponds to your *PayPal for Business* account, and then configure the *PayPal.com* provider with the *Client ID*
and *Secret* obtained above:

#. Go to *Invoicing > Configuration > Banks > Add a Bank Account*.
#. In the *Account Number* field, enter some descriptive text for the account, such as the email address or *PayPal
   Merchant ID* of your *PayPal for Business* account. NOTE: This *Account Number* is not used in the authentication
   with PayPal's API, and is only used to distinguish this PayPal Bank Account/Journal from others you may have
   configured.
#. Fill in the other fields for the Bank Account if desired, and then click *Create*.
#. Go to *Invoicing > Configuration > Accounting > Journals*.
#. Open and *Edit* the Journal corresponding to the PayPal bank account (this Journal was created automatically
   when you created the Bank Account above.
#. Set *Bank Feeds* to *Online (OCA)*.
#. Select *PayPal.com* as the provider in the *Online Bank Statements (OCA)* section.
#. *Save* the Journal.
#. To configure provider-specific settings, click on the provider to open it and click *Edit*.
#. Fill in your desired *Configuration* and *Scheduled Pull* settings.
#. Leave the *API base* field empty, and fill in the *Client ID* and *Secret* from your PayPal
   Developer account.
#. Click *Save*.

NOTE: For development and testing purposes, you can create Sandbox credentials associated with your *PayPal
for Business* account. When configuring the provider-specific settings, enter the following in the *API base* field:
https://api.sandbox.paypal.com

Usage
=====

To pull historical bank statements:

#. Go to *Invoicing > Configuration > Accounting > Journals*.
#. Open the Journal corresponding to the PayPal bank account.
#. Click the *Pull Online Bank Statement* button.
#. Configure a date interval and click *Pull*.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Only transactions for the previous three years are retrieved, historical data
  can be imported manually, see ``account_bank_statement_import_paypal``. See
  `PayPal Help Center article <https://www.paypal.com/us/smarthelp/article/why-can't-i-access-transaction-history-greater-than-3-years-ts2241>`_
  for details.
* `PayPal Transaction Info <https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/transaction-search/v1/#definition-transaction_info>`_
  defines extra fields like ``tip_amount``, ``shipping_amount``, etc. that
  could be useful to be decomposed from a single transaction.
* There's a known issue with PayPal API that on every Monday for couple of
  hours after UTC midnight it returns ``INVALID_REQUEST`` incorrectly: their
  servers have not inflated the data yet. PayPal tech support confirmed this
  behaviour in case #06650320 (private).
