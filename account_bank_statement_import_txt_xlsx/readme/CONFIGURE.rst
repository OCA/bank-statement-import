* Create or go to a bank journal where you want to import the txt statement.
* Edit that journal and set a Txt map in **Statement Import Map** section in **Advanced
  Settings** tab.

* Now you can import Text based statements in that journal.

Note: if existent Txt Map does not fit to your file to import, you can
create another map in **Invoicing > Configuration > Accounting >
Statement Import Map**.

You can import headers from any Txt file in **Action > Create Map
Lines** and set every line with which field of statement have to match.
