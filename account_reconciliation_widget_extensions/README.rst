Account Reconciliation Widget Extensions
========================================

This module restores a feature from Odoo version 8. When a user imports a
bank statement and the partner of the statement line is not present in
the database, then it will be shown as placeholder in the partner selection
field of the reconciliation widget.

The feature can be tested with file: account_bank_statement_import_qif/tests/test_qif.qif.

Known issues / Roadmap
