This module add a generic wizard to import Bank Statements. It also extend
the bank account module to sanitize the account number and extend the search
method to use this field when searching on account_number.

The module has been initiated by a backport of the new framework developed

it has reach a stage where maintaining a pure backport of 9.0 in 8.0 is not
feasible anymore
