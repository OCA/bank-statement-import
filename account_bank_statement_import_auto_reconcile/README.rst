This addon allows you have Odoo reconcile transactions from a bank statement
import automatically in cases where the matching transaction can be determined
unambigously.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. go to the journal your bank account uses
#. in tab ``Automatic reconciliation rules``, add at least one rule

Reconciliation rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Odoo standard
        Do exactly what Odoo does when proposing reconciliations. This searches for an exact match on amount and reference first, but falls back to less exact matches if none are found before. If there's only one match, do the reconciliation
    Exact amount and reference
        Strictly only match if we have the same partner, amount and reference. Check at least one field one the statement and one field on the move lines to tell the rule which fields to match with each other.

Usage
=====

After a journal is configured for automatic reconciliations, it simply happens during an import on this journal if you don't disable the `auto reconcile` checkbox on the import wizard. If there were automatic reconciliations, you'll see a notification about that and the lines in question will also show up as reconciled.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* add more matching rules:
    * AmountDiffuse (let the user configure the threshold)
    * SameCompany (if A from company C bought it, but B from the same company/organization pays)
    * AmountTransposedDigits (reconcile if only two digits are swapped. Dangerous and a special case of AmountDiffuse)
    * whatever else we can think of
* add some helpers/examples for using the options field
* allow to fiddle with the parameters of configured rules during a specific import

Background
~~~~~~~~~~

Mainly, this module is a framework for conveniently (for programmers) adding new custom automatic reconciliation rules. To do this, study the provided AbstractModels.
