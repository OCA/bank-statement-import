This module is the successor of the module **account_bank_statement_import** that was part of Odoo Community until Odoo v13 and was moved to Odoo Enterprise for Odoo v14 (cf `this commit <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/9ba8734f15e1a292ca27b1a026e8366a91b2a8c9>`_). We decided to change its name and the name of the wizard object it provides in order to avoid a conflict with the Enterprise module.

This module has several additionnal feature:

* support multi-account bank statement files,
* attach the file to the bank statement (to facilitate the diagnostic in case of problem),
* improved error messages.

This module only provides the technical framework for the import of statement files. You must also install the format-specific modules to add support for the statement file formats that your banks/provide use. For example, the OCA module **account_statement_import_ofx** will add support for the OFX (Open Financial Exchange) file format. You will find those modules in the OCA project `bank-statement-import <https://github.com/OCA/bank-statement-import>`_ or, for the country-specific formats, in the OCA localization projects.

Usage
=====

To import a statement file, go to the Invoicing dashboard: on a bank journal, you will see a button to import a statement. When you click on that button, a wizard will start and it will show the list of the supported file formats. Select the statement file that you want to import and click on the **Import** button. Odoo will create a new bank statement (or several if your statement file is a multi-account file).

If your statement file contains transactions that were already imported in Odoo, they will not be created a second time.

If the statement file contains information about the bank account number of the counter-part for some transactions (only a few statement file formats support that, in some countries) and that these bank account numbers exists on partners in Odoo, the partners will be set on the related statement lines.
