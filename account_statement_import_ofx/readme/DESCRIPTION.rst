This module adds support for the import of bank statements in `OFX format <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Financial_Exchange>`_.

Bank Statements may be generated containing a subset of the OFX information (only those transaction lines that are required for the
creation of the Financial Accounting records).

Since v14, this module support multi-account OFX files i.e. several different bank accounts in the same OFX file.
