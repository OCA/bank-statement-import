Module to import Dutch ING bank format transaction files. The format covered
is the CSV format with either 'dd-mm-yyyy' or 'yyyymmdd' date syntax.

As the ING bank does not provide detailed specification concerning possible
values and their meaning for the fields in the CSV file format, the statements
are parsed according to an educated guess based on incomplete information.
You can contact the banking-addons developers through their launchpad page and
help improve the performance of this import filter on
https://launchpad.net/banking-addons.

Note that imported bank transfers are organized in statements covering periods
of one week, even if the imported files cover a different period.

This modules contains no logic, just an import filter for account_banking.
